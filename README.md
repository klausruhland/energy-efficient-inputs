<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About the Project: Sustainable Inputs

sustainable-inputs is a collection of floating labeled html inputs and their css definitions without any use of JavaScript. 
Additionally input validation is provided based on the html input attributes
* required
* type (email,number,...)
* pattern

## Sustainability

sustainable-inputs do not need JavaScript at all. Less JavaScript means less power consumption. It's only a little step but the multiplier can be high.

1. No JavaScript is used, network traffic is reduced
2. Client-side validation is done only with CSS - no JavaScript framework is needed
3. Less JavaScript means also less maintenance
4. Less JavaScript increases Security
