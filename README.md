<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About the Project: cssonly Inputs with Validation

sustainable-inputs is a collection of html inputs and css definitions without any use of JavaScript. 
Client-side input validation is only based on the input attributes
* required
* type (email,number,...)
* pattern

## Why Sustainable

sustainable-inputs do not need JavaScript at all. Less JavaScript means less energy consumption. It's only a little step but the multiplier can be high.

1. No JavaScript is used, network traffic is reduced to a minimum
2. Client-side validation is done only with CSS - no JavaScript framework is needed
