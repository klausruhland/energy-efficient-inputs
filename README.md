<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

sustainable-inputs is a collection of html inputs and css definitions without any use of JavaScript. 
Client-side input validation is only based on the input attributes
* required
* type (email,number,...)
* pattern

## Sustainability

It's only a little step but multiplier can be high. Less JavaScript means less energy consumption


1. No JavaScript is used, network traffic is reduced to a minimum
2. Client-side validation is done only with CSS - no JavaScript framework is needed
